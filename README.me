A/L Z-Score Prediction Model

Overview
This machine learning application predicts the Z-Score for Sri Lankan Advanced Level examinations based on the 2020 examination results dataset. The model takes into account various factors including the student's stream, syllabus type (new/old), gender, and expected results for three subjects to generate an estimated Z-Score.
